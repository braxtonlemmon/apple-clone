# CSS Backgrounds and Gradients Project
Project based on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients?ref=lnav) curriculum. This project involves replicating an old version of Apple.com's [homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) while focusing on learning to use CSS to manipulate backgrounds and color gradients.
